Astrocanvas's documentation
===================

AstroCanvas is an application designed to perform a basic data reduction of raw images and to obtain some basic scientific results (lightcurves, spectra, ect), it could be also used to get some astronomical images (like gray or rgb images).

The main goal is provide an easy solution for the basic astronomical data management. Astrocanvas is simple and quick to learn how it operates, it offers a solution for amateurs or students who do not know a computational languaje.

Astrocanvas has been written in Python, especially with the libraries Tkinter, Astropy and matplotlib, a knowledge of them could be useful but not neccessary, it is expectad that this documentation will be a complete explanation about the operation of Astrocanvas.
